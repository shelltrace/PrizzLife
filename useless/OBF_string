I don't wanna come out strange
Excuse the look on my face
I'm tryin' my best to behave
Is it gonna sound cliché
Feel like we should be closer
Tomorrow I wanna know you
I don't wanna know what you're drinkin'
I just wanna know what you're thinkin'
At the end of the night
At the end of the night
At the end of the night
I don't wanna stand up again
Show me everything that you're feeling
At the end of the night
At the end of the night
At the end of the night
Fuck all of the small talk
Give me all the real stuff
Let's start
At the end of the night
At the end of the night
At the end of the night
Tell me all your secrets
Kiss me like you mean it
Let's start
At the end of the night
At the end of the night
At the end of the night
At the end of the night
Don't know how long I've been waiting
For change my life conversation
Could you change my life
Could you do it tonight
Excuse my fucking impatience
I'm just tryna get you naked
Body to mind
Your body to mind
I don't wanna know what you're drinkin'
I just wanna know what you're thinkin'
At the end of the night
At the end of the night
At the end of the night
I don't wanna stand up again
Show me everything that you're feeling
At the end of the night
At the end of the night
At the end of the night
Fuck all of the small talk
Give me all the real stuff
Let's start
At the end of the night
At the end of the night
At the end of the night
Tell me all your secrets
Kiss me like you mean it
Let's start
At the end of the night
At the end of the night
At the end of the night
At the end of the night
At the end
Fuck all of the small talk
Give me all the real stuff
Let's start, yeah
Let's start
Tell me all your secrets
Kiss me like you mean it
Let's start
Let's start
